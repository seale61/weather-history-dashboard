## Full Stack Development Tutorial - Part 3
This tutorial uses the OpenWeatherMap API key, databases, and data created in parts 1 and 2 of this tutorial series. If you have not completed the work in the first two tutorials, this project will not work.  

## Framework: Vue 2 + Vuetify
## Demo
A working demonstration of this web application can be found [here](https://weathertrend.sealeweb.com). This is a responsive app and works well on mobile devices.  

## Installation  
    git clone https://github.com/seale61/weather-history-dashboard.git
    cd weather-history-dashboard
    npm install

This app also requires the installation of it's associated API (tutorial part 2) running as a service. An upcoming tutorial will be provided on how to install a node RESTful API as a service.
